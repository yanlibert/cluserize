# clusterize
Turns a pool of machines with ssh access into a full-fledge Kubernetes cluster

## Why use clusterize?

clusterize is a side-project initiated during a DevOps training. I had several machines with ssh and root access at my disposal and I wanted to create a Kubernetes cluster using as much automation as possible.

My idea was: Terraform K8s nodes using the vagrant provider with ansible provisioned to make sure that kubeadm is running.

## Requirements

On your master machine, make sure you have Terraform and Ansible installed. On Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial, type

```sh
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.11.7/terraform_0.11.7_linux_amd64.zip
unzip terraform_0.11.7_linux_amd64.zip
sudo mv terraform /usr/bin
```
! Note: this version of clusterize was developped and tested with Terraform 0.11.7
